The Blocks World defines the following predicates and planning operators.

PREDICATES

    on(X,Y)    - X is directly placed on Y.
    onTable(X) - X is on the table.
    clear(X)   - X has nothing above it, it is clear.
    holding(X) - The arm is holding X.
    armEmpty   - The arm is not holding any block, it is empty.

OPERATORS

Pickup(X) - Pick up X from the table.
    Preconditions: { armEmpty, clear(X), onTable(X) }
    Add-Effects  : { holding(X) }
    Del-Effects  : { armEmpty, onTable(X) }

Putdown(X) - Place X on the table.
    Preconditions: { holding(X) }
    Add-Effects  : { armEmpty, onTable(X) }
    Del-Effects  : { holding(X) }

Unstack(X,Y) - Pick up X which is directly on Y.
    Preconditions: { armEmpty, clear(X), on(X,Y) }
    Add-Effects  : { clear(Y), holding(X) }
    Del-Effects  : { armempty, on(X,Y) }

Stack(X,Y) - Place X on Y.
    Preconditions: { holding(X), clear(Y) }
    Add-Effects  : { armEmpty, on(X,Y) }
    Del-Effects  : { holding(X), clear(Y) }


Consider the following planning problem being solved by the Graphplan algorithm.

		

Start: { onTable(E), onTable(C),
         clear(A), clear(D), clear(B),
         on(A,E), on(D,C),
         holding(B) }

Goal: { on(C,A), on(B,D) }

The figure below is an AND-OR graph that depicts how a problem S can be decomposed and transformed into one or more, hopefully simpler, problems. Each node has a unique label (S, A, B, â€¦). The number in each node is the heuristic estimate of the cost of solving that node.

Nodes in double circles are primitive nodes, and their values are actual costs. Observe that a primitive node is added to the graph by its parent when the parent is expanded, and the primitive node is labeled as SOLVED and it will not be expanded subsequently.

Tie-breaker 1: If several nodes have the same cost then break the tie using node labels.
Tie-breaker 2: For AND nodes, select the unsolved branch with the highest cost.



The cost of each edge is 2 units.
Solve the problem using AO* algorithm, then answer the questions below.

In the given AND-OR graph, how many full solutions (full decompositions) exist for the problem S? Count the number of full solutions.

Enter a number.
