Assignment No: 10
1).In Production Systems, refractoriness refers to __________ .
 the ability to refactor the patterns in a rule in order to create an efficient Rete Net
 the ability to prevent a matching rule-data tuple from firing repeatedly
 the process of refactoring the cycle into Match, Resolve, and Execute phases
 all of the above

2).Select the correct options. In a Production System, the working memory __________ .
 acts as a short-term memory
 acts as a long-term memory where all facts are stored
 may get updated after a rule is fired
 is cleaned up after each rule is fired to prevent the same rule from firing on the same data

3).Select the correct options. In a Production System, rules ________ .
 act as a short-term memory
 act as a long-term memory
 when fired in different order may produce different results
 will fire repeatedly on old data, as long as the working memory retains the old data

4).What does a conflict set contain?
 Rule-data tuples for different rules that match the same set of WMEs.
 Rule-data tuples for the same rule that matches different sets of WMEs.
 Rule-data tuples that are ready to fire in a given cycle.
 None of the above

5).In a Match-Resolve-Execute cycle, the Match phase ______________ .
 decides which WMEs reside in which node in the Rete Net
 selects the rule-data tuple that will fire in the current cycle
 prepares rule-data tuples ready to fire in the current cycle
 updates the Working Memory for each INSERT/MODIFY/DELETE action

6).When a WME enters a Rete Net ______________.
 it resides in each alpha node along a path that matches the WME
 it resides in the deepest alpha node along each path that leads to a rule
 it may reside in several alpha nodes
 it resides only in one alpha node in the Rete Net

7).After the first round of rule firing, the newly created WME is _________ .
 (nat ^a 0 ^b 1)
 (nat ^b 0 ^c 3)
 (nat ^b 3 ^c 0)

8).After rule-2 is fired for the first time, the newly created WME is _________ .
 (nat ^b 3 ^c 0)
 (nat ^b 2 ^c 3)
 (nat ^b 1 ^c 6)

9).In total, rule-2 is fired __________ times.

Enter a number.
